# Changelog

## 0.6.2
- `stream_ocel_file_to_duckdb` / `_with` infer the format the way `OCEL` does and accept every format it imports from, bundles included
  - `.json`/`.xml` (and `.gz`), bundles, and a `DuckDB` source in the consolidated schema stream into the database, holding no log in memory
  - `.sqlite`, `.ocel.csv` and a `.duckdb` in the OCEL 2.0 per-type layout are materialized first (no streaming support yet)
  - Importing onto the source's own path is now an error instead of deleting the source
- `Container::read_into` reads a bundle into any `AppendableOCEL` sink, skipping the intermediate `OCEL`. `Container::read` and `SlimLinkedOCEL`'s bundle import both go through it
- A bundle manifest path pointing outside the container is rejected before any table is read
- `OCEL`'s format inference recognizes `.sqlite3` as SQLite, alongside `.sqlite` and `.db`

## 0.6.1
- **Breaking:** Removed `KuzuDB` export (the `kuzudb` feature, the `core::event_data::object_centric::graph_db` module and the `ocel_kuzudb_export` example). Kuzu is no longer maintained upstream.
- Added extraction blueprints (`extraction-blueprint`): A declarative model for building an OCEL from relational data, with a row executor, a SQL-view compiler, a validator, and in-memory and `DuckDB` sinks
  - Feature `extraction-dbcon` adds a `RowProvider` over SQLite, CSV and Parquet via `dbcon`, all readable from bytes and buildable for `wasm32`
  - Feature `extraction-dbcon-postgres` adds PostgreSQL, which needs `sqlx` and is native-only
- Added the OCEL 2.0 bundled CSV/Parquet format (`ocel-bundle`, plus `ocel-bundle-parquet` for Parquet storage): An `.ocel.zip` archive or a directory with the same layout, read and written through `Importable`/`Exportable` like any other OCEL format
  - `Exportable::export_to_path_as` writes to a path in an explicitly named format, for paths that cannot carry one (e.g., a directory)
  - Snappy-compressed Parquet is now readable, which is what most other Parquet writers emit by default
- OCEL 2.0 CSV tweaks
  - An event attribute column is written under its plain name; the `ea:` prefix is no longer produced on export, and any column that is not `id`, `activity`, `timestamp` or `ot:<X>` is an event attribute. Import still strips a leading `ea:` so older files read unchanged
  - An object id or qualifier containing `/`, `#`, `{` or `\` is escaped with a backslash on export and read back on import
  - An `ot:<X>` header names the object type exactly, and an event attribute value is kept as written; both were trimmed before
  - A value is only read as a number or an instant when its text is the canonical spelling of one; `007`, `+7`, `1e3`, an integer too large for `i64`, and a timestamp with no timezone stay strings
  - `strict` rejects an o2o row whose source object has no declared type; the check sat inside a `verbose` branch, so `strict` alone dropped the row silently
- Added the `ocel_dataset_crosscheck` example: walks a directory of dataset folders, each holding the log it started from under `source/` and its re-exports (`.ocel.zip`, `.ocel.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.sqlite`) beside it, reads every re-export back and reports where it disagrees with the source, separating differences in values from ones only in the attribute variant or recorded time
- `ocel_sql` exposes the `DuckDB` consolidated schema: `DuckDbLinkedOCEL`, `stream_ocel_file_to_duckdb` / `_with`, `DuckDbImportOptions`, and `read_consolidated_ocel_from_duckdb_path` / `read_consolidated_slim_ocel_from_duckdb_path`
- `SqlOcelImportOptions` with `import_ocel_sqlite_from_con_with_options` / `import_ocel_sqlite_from_path_with_options` / `import_ocel_duckdb_from_con_with_options`
- An object-type table without its `ocel_changed_field` column is now read as initial state (configurable with `allow_missing_changed_field: false`)
- `StreamImportOCEL` streams a reader or a path into any `AppendableOCEL` and finalizes it; `is_streaming_format` reports which formats it covers
- `TabularSource` holds the bytes of a tabular file (`SQLite`, CSV, Parquet, workbook) in the registry, so a binding can name a dropped file by id where there is no filesystem
- `OCELAttributeType::coalesce`: the narrowest type covering two others, used by CSV type inference
- `OCELEvent.time` accepts the non-RFC3339 timestamp formats the rest of the crate parses
- `AggregatedEventTimestamps::bin_width_ms` (new field) makes the bin width explicit: the spacing of the bin centers, and `0` when there are no bins; before it was implicit and a caller re-deriving it could disagree with the centers (**Breaking**)

- Fixed a regression in OC-DECLARE discovery/conformance runtime performance:
  - Now builds and construct a reverse-E2O index grouped by event type
  - OC-DECLARE internals are no longer public; their arguments could only be produced by other internals (**Breaking**)
    - `conformance::oc_declare::{get_evs_with_objs_perf, get_for_ev_perf, get_for_all_evs_perf, get_for_all_evs_perf_thresh}`
    - `discovery::object_centric::oc_declare::{get_oi_labels, combine_constraints}`
    - Per-arc checking is unchanged: `oc_declare_conformance`, `OCDeclareArc::violation_fraction`, `OCDeclareArc::satisfies_threshold`
  - `OCDeclareArc::get_for_all_evs_perf` -> `violation_fraction`, `OCDeclareArc::get_for_all_evs_perf_thresh` -> `satisfies_threshold` (**Breaking**)
  - Fixed `ANY` object involvements counting a target event once per referenced object instead of once

## 0.6.0

- Optimal Petri net alignments (`conformance::alignments`):
  - `align_log` / `align_projection` / `align_trace` / `align_empty_trace` compute cost-optimal alignments via Dijkstra over a synchronous product net
  - `compute_fitness` derives log/trace fitness for pre-computed alignments
  - Configurable `AlignmentOptions` (`CostFunction`, `max_states`)
  - Exposed as bindings
- Generic, reusable state-space search in `utils::dijkstra_search` (`SearchProblem` trait + `search`)
- `register_binding` macro accepts slice arguments (`&[T]` extracted as `Vec<T>`)
- New `ReadableOCEL` and `AppendableOCEL` traits; OCEL exporters (CSV, XML, SQL, JSON) and the JSON importer are generic over them
- `SlimLinkedOCEL` implements `AppendableOCEL`, with auto-declare types, auto-grow attributes, and value coercion via new `OCELAttributeValue::try_coerce_to`; misordered streams are buffered and resolved on `finalize`
- `import_ocel_json_into` and `import_ocel_xml_into` stream JSON / XML directly into any `AppendableOCEL` (e.g., `SlimLinkedOCEL`) without materializing an `OCEL` first; `SlimLinkedOCEL::import_from_*` uses the streaming paths automatically
- `ReadableOCEL::iter_events_of_type` / `iter_objects_of_type` (default filters; `SlimLinkedOCEL` overrides via per-type indices, avoiding a full scan per type in SQL export)
- New `OCELAttributeType::as_type_str` returns `&'static str` (cheaper than `to_type_string`)
- `EventIndex` / `ObjectIndex` are now `u32`-backed; `into_inner` returns `u32` (**Breaking**)
- `SlimLinkedOCEL`, `SlimOCELEvent`, `SlimOCELObject` no longer derive `Deserialize` (still serialize); construct via `Importable` or `AppendableOCEL` (**Breaking**)
- `SlimOCELEvent::relationships` and `SlimOCELObject::relationships` are now `Vec<(QualifierIdx, ObjectIndex)>` (was `Vec<(String, ObjectIndex)>`); resolve qualifier strings via `SlimLinkedOCEL::qualifier_str` (**Breaking**)
- CSV exporter streams rows instead of buffering all rows; tracks `(time, object_id)` pairs in a `HashSet` to skip redundant object-attribute rows
- `SlimLinkedOCEL::from_ocel` now goes through `AppendableOCEL`, so it shares attribute coercion, schema-grow, and duplicate-id detection with the streaming import paths. Behavior changes: events/objects with attribute names not in the declared type schema grow the schema (before they were silently dropped); duplicate event/object ids are skipped with a warning (before they were kept but unreachable); references to undeclared types auto-create the type (before they were dropped with warning)
- `try_json_to_ocel` returning `Result<OCEL, serde_json::Error>` added alongside the existing panicking `json_to_ocel`
- `SlimLinkedOCEL::get_o2o_rev_obs_of_obtype` / `get_e2o_rev_evs_of_evtype`: qualifier-optional reverse-relation getters filtered by type
- New public object-centric analysis functions (also exposed as bindings): per-event sojourn and synchronization times with optional `top_k` (`analysis::object_centric::oc_performance`), E2O `(event_type, object_type)` counts and `source -> target` conversion rate (`analysis::object_centric::oc_statistics`), and per-object-type directly-follows graph and activity-trace variants (`discovery::object_centric::dfg` / `variants`)
- Fix SQL export/import of floats and timestamps: floats are written as `DOUBLE PRECISION` (full f64 precision) and timestamps as naive UTC (avoids a double-applied timezone offset); import maps `DOUBLE` / `DOUBLE PRECISION` columns back to float, so round-trips no longer drop float attributes
- New direct dependency on `hashbrown` for the slim per-id hash tables

## 0.5.6

- Translate a `ProcessTree` into a `PetriNet`:
  - `ProcessTree::to_petri_net` returns a workflow net with initial and final marking set
  - `add_to_petri_net` on `Node` / `Operator` / `Leaf` for recursive insertion into an existing net
  - `From<ProcessTree> for PetriNet`
- Bump MSRV to 1.88
- Update dependencies (pin `cxx-build` to match `kuzu`'s `cxx`, refresh `cargo deny` license allowlist)
- Add Criterion + dhat benchmarks for event log import (+ DataFrame conversion)

## 0.5.5

- `SlimLinkedOCEL` and bindings:
  - `add_event` / `add_object` pad or truncate `attributes` to the declared length with a warning, instead of causing out-of-bounds panics later
  - `add_e2o` / `add_o2o` / `delete_e2o` / `delete_o2o` return `bool`; invalid indices warn and return `false` instead of panicking
  - Multiple qualifiers between the same `(event, object)` or `(from, to)` pair are kept, and reverse lookups return every qualifier
  - `fat_ev` / `fat_ob` fall back to `Null` / empty attribute on missing positional values
  - Drop `unwrap()`s on unknown type names in reverse-type lookups
  - Expanded docstrings on `slim_ocel_bindings` for the auto-generated Python API docs
- `Importable` / `Exportable` for `SlimLinkedOCEL` aligned with the `OCEL` versions
- OCEL import/export supports `.gz` for all formats
- Better defaults for OCEL 2.0 CSV export

## 0.5.4

- Add `stream_xes_bufread` function for streaming XES traces from a `BufRead` (supports gzipped input)
- Remove noisy `println!` in OCEL XML import for extended OCELs

## 0.5.3

- Parse XES version from log element
- Fix some missing unescapes in XML-based imports (XES, PNML)

## 0.5.2

- New `analysis` module with reusable analysis functions (also exposed as bindings ;))
  - `analysis::case_centric::dotted_chart`: Configurable multi-axis dotted chart generation (`DottedChartOptions`)
  - `analysis::case_centric::event_timestamp_histogram`: Aggregate event timestamps into bins grouped by activity (`EventTimestampOptions`)
  - `analysis::object_centric::object_attribute_changes`: Extract time-stamped attribute change history for an OCEL object

## 0.5.1
- Rename bindings function for SlimLinkedOCEL bindings (not breaking, as 0.5.0 bindings were not published yet)

## 0.5.0
- Fix SlimLinkedOCEL addObject function (previously did not correctly expand the reverse E2O/O2O reference array)
- Change error type of OCEL XML import to `OCELIOError` 
(**Breaking**), return error if XML does not contain any event or object types
  - Added related test (`test_xes_as_ocel_xml_import`) to ensure xes files are not correctly imported as OCEL
- Implement `Default` for SlimLinkedOCEL, add `new` function for SlimLinkedOCEL
- Expose SlimLinkedOCEL binding functions (e.g., for adding events/objects, getting relations, etc.)
- Implement From<...> for (bi-directional) conversion between (XES) `AttributeValue`s to `OCELAttributeValue`s
- Remove `Hash` derive from `OCELType` (**Breaking**)

## 0.4.4
- Fix version mismatch in macros crate

## 0.4.3
- Fix: typo in function name: `oc_declare_conformace` -> `oc_declare_conformance` (**Breaking**)

## 0.4.2
- **New OCEL CSV Format**
  - Added CSV format support for OCEL:
  - Added Importer/Exporter for CSV OCEL file format
  - Added CSV file format to OCEL io trait + known formats (as `.ocel.csv`)
- **Bindings Improvements**:
  - Exposed OC-DECLARE conformance function (`oc_declare_conformace`) to bindings
  - Renamed `discover_oc-declare` binding to `discover_oc_declare` (**Breaking for Bindings**)
  - Renamed `discover_dfg_from_locel` to `discover_dfg_from_ocel` (**Breaking**)
  - Added `SlimLinkedOCEL` <-> `OCEL` conversion support in bindings
  - Implemented `LinkedOCELAccess` trait support in bindings macro for more generic functions
  - Added `ocel_type_stats` binding to compute event/object type statistics
  - Exposed `flatten_ocel_on` function to bindings for flattening OCEL on object types
  - Exposed `add_init_exit_events_to_ocel` function to bindings
- **Other Fixes and Improvements**:
  - Fixed SQLite/DuckDB export to remove existing file before export (prevents UNIQUE constraint errors)
  - Combined/Deduped timestamp-related parsing functionality across files
  - Implemented `Null` as default `OCELAttributeValue`
- **Internal Improvements**:
  - Updated `rusqlite` and related dependencies
  - Improved CLI in `r4pm`

### Breaking Changes / Migration Guide
- The `From<OCELAttributeValue>` implementation for `OCELAttributeType` was removed. Instead, use the `get_type` function on `OCELAttributeValue` to retrieve its type.
- Updates related to io module for CSV parsing (e.g., new error variant in `OCELIOError`)
- Renamed binding `discover_oc-declare` to `discover_oc_declare`

## 0.4.1
- Added `verbose` option to `XESImportOptions`, defaulting to true
  - Note: Technically this is a breaking change, however the recommended way to use `XESImportOptions` is non-exhaustive with default fallback:
    - e.g., ```XESImportOptions {verbose: false, ..Default::default()}```

## 0.4.0

### Restructuring (Current)
- **Unified IO Traits**: Introduced `Importable` and `Exportable` traits in `process_mining::core::io` to standardize import and export operations across different data structures.
- **EventLog IO**: Implemented `Importable` and `Exportable` for `EventLog`, supporting JSON (`.json`), XES (`.xes`), and Gzipped XES (`.xes.gz`) formats.
- **PetriNet IO**: Implemented `Importable` and `Exportable` for `PetriNet`, supporting PNML (`.pnml`) format.
- **OCEL IO**: Implemented `Importable` and `Exportable` for Object-Centric Event Logs (OCEL), including support for SQLite and DuckDB (if features enabled).
- **Format Inference**: Added automatic format inference based on file extensions (e.g., `.xes`, `.xes.gz`, `.pnml`).
- **Auto-Bindings**: Added auto-binding functionality to facilitate Python bindings generation.
- **Module Restructuring**:
    - Moved Alpha+++ discovery to `process_mining::discovery`.
    - Moved Petri nets to `process_mining::core::process_models`.
    - Moved DFG discovery to `process_mining::discovery`.
- **API Simplification**: Users can now use generic `import_from_path` and `export_to_path` methods. These methods now strictly rely on file extension for format inference, removing the optional format argument.

### Features (Unreleased on crates.io)
- **KuzuDB Support**: Added initial support for OCEL export to KuzuDB.
- **DuckDB Support**: Added example for OCEL export to DuckDB.
- **Polars Export**: Added OCEL to Polars DataFrame export.
- **Object-Centric Process Trees**: Added implementation of object-centric process trees and abstraction-based conformance checking.
- **Token-Based Replay**: Implemented token-based replay on Petri nets.
- **Incidence Matrices**: Added incidence matrices for Petri nets.
- **Event Log Macros**: Implemented macros for easier event log creation.
- **OC-DECLARE**: Object-centric declarative process models, with discovery and conformance checking.

### Changed
- **Exposed Fields**: Exposed `OCLanguageAbstraction` fields.

### Migration Guide
- **Importing Event Logs**:
  - Old: `import_xes_file("log.xes")`
  - New: `EventLog::import_from_path("log.xes")`
- **Exporting Event Logs**:
  - New: `log.export_to_path("log.xes")`
- **Traits**: Ensure `process_mining::Importable` and `process_mining::Exportable` are in scope if you need to use the traits generically.
- **Format Specification**: If you need to specify a format explicitly (e.g., reading from a stream or non-standard extension), use `import_from_reader` or `export_to_writer` which still accept a format string.
