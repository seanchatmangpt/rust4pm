//! activities this is the most expensive thing the miner does.
//!
//! Warshall's algorithm is `O(n³)` no matter how few edges there are. Instead the graph is
//! collapsed into its strongly connected components first: within a component everything reaches
//! everything and what is left is acyclic, so one sweep in reverse topological order suffices,
//! with each component inheriting the union of what its successors reach. That is `O(n + m)`
//! unions of bit rows, and directly-follows graphs are sparse.
