//! The minimum-self-distance relation of an event log.
//!
//! The self distance of an activity `a` is the number of events between two consecutive
//! occurrences of `a`, and the minimum over the log is its minimum self distance. The activities
//! occurring between two occurrences at exactly that distance are in the minimum-self-distance
//! relation with `a`.
//!
//! Concurrency detection uses this to tell a loop from concurrency (∧↔.1), which the
//! directly-follows graph alone cannot do. In the log `[⟨a, b, a⟩, ⟨b, a, b⟩]` both `a ↦ b` and
//! `b ↦ a` hold, so `a` and `b` look concurrent, but `b` always sits between two `a`s.
