//! Connected components of the *complement* of a sparse relation.
//!
//! The concurrent and sequence cuts group activities that may not be separated, and on a real
//! graph almost every pair has to be merged, so that relation is nearly complete. Building it and
//! merging pair by pair costs `O(n²)` union-find operations.
//!
//! Computing the components on the complement, which is the sparse relation, avoids that. The
//! search keeps the vertices it has not placed in one list and, for every vertex it visits, walks
//! that list once: everything not separated from the vertex joins its component and leaves the
//! list. Each step either removes a vertex, at most `n` times, or passes over one edge of the
//! sparse relation, so this is `O(n + m)`.

/// Groups `0..n` into the connected components of the complement of `separate`.
///
/// Two elements share a component unless `separate` holds for them, so `separate` describes the
/// edges absent from the graph being decomposed. It must be symmetric, and `separate(a, a)` is
/// never called.
///
/// Components are sorted internally and ordered by their smallest element, so the result does not
/// depend on the order the search visited things in.
