//! Log splitting: dividing a log into the sub-logs the recursion continues on.
//!
//! Every cut comes with a way to split the log into one sub-log per part, so that recombining the
//! discovered sub-trees with the cut's operator reproduces the original behaviour.
//!
//! Leemans defines two families: the plain splits for IM and filtering ones for `IMf` that discard
//! events the cut cannot explain. Only the filtering ones are implemented here, since they
//! coincide with the plain ones whenever the cut adheres to its footprint (§6.2.2.2), and plain IM
//! only detects cuts on an unfiltered graph so its cuts always do.
