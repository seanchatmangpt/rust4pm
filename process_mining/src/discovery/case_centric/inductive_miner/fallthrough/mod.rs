//! The miner has to return a process tree for every log, including logs whose directly-follows
//! graph shows none of the four footprints. The fall throughs are tried in a fixed order chosen to
//! preserve as much precision as possible (§6.1.2.4), each giving up a little more structure than
//! the previous. The last one, the flower model, always applies.
